# Loop Mania
## Description
- Loop Mania is a Java application built with Gradle, where players strategise by placing buildings and equipping items to support a character navigating an endless looping path. The character moves automatically through the cyclical map, engaging in battles against various enemies along the way. Players must carefully manage resources and upgrades to ensure survival and progress through increasingly challenging encounters.
